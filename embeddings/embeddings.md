## 2. Reduce Embedding Dimensions with UMAP


🎥 Dive into the Transformer Embeddings Series - Part 2: Shrinking Text Magic!

📚 In our second video, we're continuing our journey to uncover text's secrets. This time, we're learning how to make those special text codes smaller, while keeping their meaning intact. We'll do this using something called UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimensionality Reduction). These compact codes are still super useful as inputs for machine learning models and neural networks. And guess what? They're even easier to visualize and understand!

💡 Imagine making text magic even more efficient – that's what we're doing! We'll take the embeddings we learned about earlier and use UMAP to make them smaller while keeping their power. These tiny codes can be used by computers to do cool things like predicting or understanding text. And the best part? We can now see and understand them better!

⚙️ Ready to level up your text skills? These compact codes are like mini power-ups for your computer programs. By the end of this video, you'll know how to create them and make your text analyses even more exciting. Whether you're new or have some experience, this tutorial is here to help you.

🌟 Excited to transform text into tiny yet mighty codes? Hit that play button and let's embark on a journey to shrink and visualize our text codes using UMAP. Get ready to add another layer of magic to your text analysis skills! 🚀🔍

## 3. Visualization of the Embeddings

🎥 Step into the Transformer Embeddings Series - Part 3: Visualizing the Magic!

📚 Welcome to the third video of our series! Here, we're taking our text codes on a visual adventure. Remember those smaller codes we created using UMAP? Now, we'll learn how to see them in action and uncover fascinating insights. Get ready for some text magic visualization using a hexbin chart!

💡 Imagine turning these compact codes into pictures that tell us stories – that's exactly what we're doing. We'll take the tiny text codes from before and transform them into a visual format using a hexbin chart. This chart lets us see patterns and learn new things from our text.

⚙️ Ready to make your text skills even cooler? These visualizations are like maps that guide us through text worlds. By the end of this video, you'll know how to turn codes into pictures and unveil secrets hidden within the text. Whether you're new to this or have some experience, this tutorial is here to make it fun and understandable.

🌟 Excited to turn codes into captivating visuals? Press play and let's dive into the art of visualizing our text codes using a hexbin chart. Get ready to add a splash of creativity to your text analysis journey! 🚀📊
